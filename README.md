Calamities can have a significant impact on society. It may result in an enormous number of people being evacuated. The local government unit assigned evacuation centers to provide temporary shelter for people during disasters. Evacuation centers are provided to give temporary shelter for the people during and after a calamity. Evacuation centers can be churches, sports stadium community centers, and much more that are capable to provide emergency shelter.
Evacuation centers require efficient management to ensure that evacuees are provided with the essential supplies and services. However, the local government officers encountered serious challenges and difficulties in managing the evacuation centers. They usually encounter management issues like shortages in supplies and essential goods, errors in headcounts of evacuees, inefficient recording of information and other related activities to be managed in an evacuation center.
The capstone project, entitled “Evacuation Center Management System” is designed to automate the management processes of evacuation centers. The said system will assist the local government disaster risk reduction personnel in managing evacuees and their needs. The evacuation center staff can electronically conduct all sorts of recordings plus an inventory of supplies for the evacuees.

Introduction
The capstone project, “Evacuation Center Management System” is intended to be used by the local government in managing different evacuation centers in the locality. The system will automate different management processes in evacuation centers. It will eliminate management issues and provide efficient evacuation center management.

Evacuation centers are provided to give temporary shelter for the people during and after a calamity. Evacuation centers can be churches, sports stadium community centers, and much more that are capable to provide emergency shelter. Efficient evacuation center management is critical in providing evacuees the supplies and services they needed. Without a systematic management approach, evacuation centers cannot be managed effectively and efficiently. Management issues like shortages in essential supplies, errors in headcounts, and profiling of evacuees would likely occur. Thus, there is an intensified need to improve the current method used in managing evacuation centers.

Proposed Solution
To address the above-mentioned concerns, the researchers proposed an automated evacuation center management system. The proposed system will automate the management processes for an evacuation center. The evacuation center staff can electronically conduct all sorts of recordings plus an inventory of supplies for the evacuees. The developed system will eliminate the difficulties and problems encountered in managing and providing the supplies and services needed by the affected people. The system will make evacuation center management easy, fast, efficient, and accurate.

Objectives of the Study
General Objective- the researchers generally aim to develop a system that will automate the management processes of evacuation centers.

The researchers specifically aim the following objectives:

To develop a system that will electronically record information of evacuees.
To eliminate management issues encountered in managing evacuation centers by employing an automated system.
To efficiently provide essential supplies and services to the evacuees.
To obtain accurate headcounts of the evacuees in every evacuation center.
To develop a system that will ease up evacuation center management.

Scope of the Study
The researchers focus on designing and developing an automated system that will automate evacuation center management processes. The system is limited to be used only by LGU evacuation centers. The system is solely for managing evacuation centers and their evacuees. The researchers will determine a sample size of LGU evacuation centers staff and the people to participate in the study.

Significance of the Study
The success of the study is deemed beneficial to the following individuals or groups:
